## Advice

The recipes in this repo have all been useful to me at different times. But no recipe will be useful in every situation. Use your best judgement and descretion when applying these recipes in your code. If you find yourself developing a new recipe not listed in this repo, I'd love you to submit an issue or PR to this repo. If I think it'll be helpful to others I'll gladly add it.
